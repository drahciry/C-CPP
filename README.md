# C & C++ Algorithm Studies

A repository dedicated to studying and implementing **data structures**, **classic algorithms**, and core programming concepts using **C and C++**. The main goal is to document the learning process and build a solid foundation in low-level programming and problem-solving.

## About This Repository

This project serves as a **learning log** for mastering C (and soon C++).  
Each directory or file focuses on a specific concept — from syntax basics to advanced memory management, binary file handling, linked lists, trees, and sorting algorithms.

---

## Topics Covered So Far

- **Programming Fundamentals:** Basic syntax, data types, operators, and scope.
- **Control Structures:** `if-else`, `switch-case`, `for`, `while`, `do-while`.
- **String Handling:** Operations with `<string.h>`, dynamic input.
- **Pointers & Dynamic Memory:** Using `malloc()`, `realloc()`, manual memory management.
- **File I/O:** Text and binary file operations, `fopen`, `fread`, `fwrite`, `fseek`, `ftell`, `rewind`.
- **Classic Data Structures:**
  - **Stack:** Implemented with arrays and linked lists.
  - **Queue:** Linear array, circular array, and linked list.
  - **Linked Lists:** Single, double, circular linked lists.
  - **Trees:** Binary Search Tree (BST) with search, insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Sorting Algorithms:**
  - **Bubble Sort**
  - **Insertion Sort**
  - **Merge Sort** (recursive and optimized)

## Next Goals

> The learning journey continues! Next up:

- **AVL & Red-Black Trees:** Theoretical understanding done, implementation is optional for now.
- **Macros with `#define`** and preprocessor best practices.
- **Proper error handling using `errno` and `perror` for robust debugging.**
- **Header file documentation with clear comments and structure.**
- **Unit tests with `<assert.h>`.**
- **Getting started with modern C++:**
  - Syntax essentials
  - Classes and OOP
  - Templates and the STL
  - Differences and similarities with C
- **Automated builds with Makefile.**
