# C & C++ Algorithm Studies

A repository for studying and implementing algorithms and fundamental programming concepts in C and C++. The main goal is to document the learning process and build a solid foundation in low-level programming.

## About This Repository

This project serves as a personal log of my journey learning C and C++. It contains a collection of programs, each designed to tackle a specific concept, ranging from basic syntax to more complex topics like memory management and file I/O. The focus is on demonstrating a clear understanding of the underlying mechanics of programming.

## Topics Covered

This repository includes implementations and examples for the following topics:

* **Programming Fundamentals:** Basic syntax, variables, data types, and operators.
* **Control Structures:** Conditional statements (`if-else`, `switch-case`) and loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
* **Core Data Structures:** Working with arrays and handling strings.
* **Functions:** Modularizing code with functions, including the use of **recursion**.
* **Memory Management:** Understanding pointers and dynamic memory allocation with `malloc()` and `realloc()`.
* **File I/O:** Performing CRUD (`Create`, `Read`, `Update`, `Delete`) operations on text files.

## Future Goals

The learning process is ongoing. The next topics to be explored are:

* Implementation of fundamental **data structures** such as linked lists, stacks, and queues.
* Deeper exploration of **C++ features**, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
