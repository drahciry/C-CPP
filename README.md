# C-C++

My repository for algorithms and programing logical in programing language C/C++. Only studying and training for show that I know programming in the low level.

## Update 10/06/2025 - 1.1

- I make some programs only show what I know do, since basic to intermediary in C/C++. I expecting learning more in next weeks

## Update 10/06/2025 - 1.2

- I implementing some programs with fundamentals knowledge of programing in C/C++.

## Update 10/06/2025 - 1.3

- I make programs using structures of control (switch-case, for, while, do-while) for show that I know this topic so important in programing.

## Update 12/06/2025 - 1.1

- I make programs showing that I know utilize arrays, strings and functions with recursion. These topic is very important for stable development in C/C++.

## Update 12/06/2025 - 1.2

- I was edited 'Phrase Analyzer' because I forgot the cases where vowels are capitalize. I append too new program with focus in strings. I plan to add more.

## Update 13/06/2025

- I have created more programs for strings. There will be more programs with this focus.

## Update 14/06/2025

- Today is saturday, so I haven't implemented many programs. But, the programs that I made today demonstrate my knowledge in C a solid way.
