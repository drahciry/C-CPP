# 📌 C & C++ Algorithm Studies

A repository dedicated to studying and implementing **data structures**, **classic algorithms**, and core programming concepts using **C and C++**. The main goal is to document the learning process and build a solid foundation in low-level programming and problem-solving.

## 🎯 About This Repository

This project serves as a **learning log** for mastering C (and soon C++).  
Each directory or file focuses on a specific concept — from syntax basics to advanced memory management, binary file handling, linked lists, trees, and sorting algorithms.

---

## ✅ Topics Covered So Far

- **Programming Fundamentals:** Basic syntax, data types, operators, and scope.
- **Control Structures:** `if-else`, `switch-case`, `for`, `while`, `do-while`.

---

## 🚀 Next Goals

> The learning journey continues! Next up:

- 📌 **AVL & Red-Black Trees:** Theoretical understanding done, implementation is optional for now.
- ⚙️ **Macros with `#define`** and preprocessor best practices.
- 🪲 **Proper error handling using `errno` and `perror` for robust debugging.**
- 🗂️ **Header file documentation with clear comments and structure.**
- ✅ **Unit tests with `<assert.h>`.**
- ⚡ **Getting started with modern C++:**
  - Syntax essentials
  - Classes and OOP
  - Templates and the STL
  - Differences and similarities with C
- 📂 **Automated builds with Makefile.**

## 🤝 Contribution

This is a personal study project, but suggestions and improvements are always welcome.  
**Pull requests** for documentation improvements or bug fixes will be reviewed.

---

## 📢 Status

> ✅ **C: solid foundation built (advanced data structures covered).**  
> 🏃 **Next: modern C++ + OOP + design patterns.**

---

## 💪 Let’s keep coding!
